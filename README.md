# Serverless-Spoon


Serverless Spoon is a meal-planning site written with a React.js frontend, and an AWS [Serverless Application Model](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) backend. A demo is currently deployed on an EC2 instance [here](http://3.91.234.197).

Its current features are: 

- Setting and tracking macronutrient goals. 
- Managing grocery inventory.
- Recipe planning and search using the [Sponnacular's API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).



The full list of API endpoints is available in [SAM-backend/ENDPOINTS.md](https://github.com/Ekhemlin/Serverless-Spoon/blob/main/SAM-backend/ENDPOINTS.md)
